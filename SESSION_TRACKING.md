## Work Unit Log

### WU1 — Core Types (`types.rs`)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | ✅ Done |
| Commit hash | `c288d328f3f0fcbe74c251c7ecf4bdc559015b3e` |
| Timestamp | 2026-03-24T04:19:51.7577759-07:00 |
| Files created/modified | `rust/crates/elegy-memory/Cargo.toml`, `rust/crates/elegy-memory/src/lib.rs`, `rust/crates/elegy-memory/src/types.rs`, `SESSION_TRACKING.md` |
| `cargo check` result | ✅ Pass after WU1 fixup — `cargo check -p elegy-memory --manifest-path C:\Users\Romain\Projects\Elegy\rust\Cargo.toml` |
| `cargo test` result | N/A for WU1 |
| Deviations from plan | Added prompt-compatibility aliases (`ContradictionRecord`, `MemorySearchQuery`, `MemorySearchResult`) plus lightweight `ScopeConfig` and `MemoryVersion` alongside the authoritative types so the prompt extras are covered without displacing the architecture-defined contracts; WU1 fixup aligned the new core timestamp fields to `chrono::DateTime<Utc>` and the primary memory identifier alias to `uuid::Uuid` while leaving existing `lib.rs` `time`-based artifact code intact. |
| Blockers encountered | Initial commit creation failed until repo-local Git author identity was configured; blocker is now resolved and the corrected WU1 commit exists. |
| Decisions made | Kept new types in a dedicated `types.rs` module and re-exported them from `lib.rs` to preserve the existing public API surface; corrected WU1 types to use `chrono::DateTime<Utc>` for prompt-facing timestamps and `uuid::Uuid` for `MemoryId`, while retaining the pre-existing `time` dependency and `lib.rs` validation/parsing code used by existing artifact flows. |
| Confidence self-assessment | 5 |

**Canary — Preview of next WU:**
> WU2 should define the trait-first API layer for the memory crate: `MemoryStore`, `EmbeddingProvider`, `SalienceGate`, `MemoryConsolidator`, and `MemoryObservability`, along with any directly supporting enums and error types needed for signatures to compile. The traits should use the new core types from `types.rs`, stay MVP-safe, and likely wire into `lib.rs` without implementing the full storage behavior yet.

### WU2 — Trait Definitions (`traits.rs`)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | ✅ Done |
| Commit hash | `7a120430a4b6ccf2ad4c074c54f4c3597118c1b0` |
| Timestamp | 2026-03-24T04:20:20-07:00 |
| Files created/modified | `rust/crates/elegy-memory/Cargo.toml`, `rust/crates/elegy-memory/src/error.rs`, `rust/crates/elegy-memory/src/lib.rs`, `rust/crates/elegy-memory/src/traits.rs`, `SESSION_TRACKING.md` |
| `cargo check` result | ✅ Pass — `cargo check -p elegy-memory --manifest-path C:\Users\Romain\Projects\Elegy\rust\Cargo.toml` |
| `cargo test` result | N/A for WU2 |
| Deviations from plan | Kept the documented trait surface intact, but represented backend-specific `StoreError::Sqlite` as a string payload for now so WU2 can remain trait-first without prematurely introducing the concrete SQLite backend dependency wiring before the storage implementation work units. |
| Blockers encountered | None after WU1 Git identity setup was resolved upstream. |
| Decisions made | Added the documented trait families (`MemoryStore`, `EmbeddingProvider`, `SalienceGate`, `MemoryConsolidator`, `MemoryObservability`) plus minimal supporting API types required by the signatures to compile (`MetadataUpdate`, `MemoryFilter`, `OptionalFieldUpdate`, `GateDecision`, `ConsolidationAction`, and the corresponding error enums); wired everything into `lib.rs` via public re-exports and added `async-trait` using the workspace dependency convention. |

### WU3 — SQLite Schema

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | ✅ Done |
| Commit hash | `1131f25258af2bfb6e733de744d428bff10fd235` |
| Timestamp | 2026-03-24T04:29:29.4578624-07:00 |
| Files created/modified | `rust/Cargo.lock`, `rust/crates/elegy-memory/Cargo.toml`, `rust/crates/elegy-memory/src/error.rs`, `rust/crates/elegy-memory/src/lib.rs`, `rust/crates/elegy-memory/src/storage/mod.rs`, `rust/crates/elegy-memory/src/storage/schema.rs`, `SESSION_TRACKING.md` |
| `cargo check` result | ✅ Pass — `cargo check -p elegy-memory --manifest-path C:\Users\Romain\Projects\Elegy\rust\Cargo.toml` |
| `cargo test` result | ✅ Pass via dedicated unit-test runner — `cargo test -p elegy-memory --manifest-path C:\Users\Romain\Projects\Elegy\rust\Cargo.toml` |
| Deviations from plan | Did not add a `sqlite-vec` Rust crate in WU3; instead `init_database()` first attempts the documented `vec0` virtual table and falls back to a rowid-compatible `vec_memories` table when the module is unavailable, with an explicit TODO to replace the fallback once runtime extension loading/integration is finalized. |
| Blockers encountered | None. |
| Decisions made | Added a new `storage` module wired through `lib.rs`, introduced `init_database(&Path) -> Result<rusqlite::Connection, StoreError>`, reused the existing trait-first `StoreError` surface with a minimal `From<rusqlite::Error>` adapter, enabled SQLite via `rusqlite` with bundled SQLite, and initialized `scope_config` with `schema_version` plus MVP-safe default tuning keys. |
| Confidence self-assessment | 4 |

### WU4 — SqliteMemoryStore CRUD

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | ✅ Done |
| Commit hash | _(recorded in git history by the WU4 finalization commit created from this finalized snapshot)_ |
| Timestamp | 2026-03-24T04:47:28.6060083-07:00 |
| Files created/modified | `rust/crates/elegy-memory/Cargo.toml`, `rust/crates/elegy-memory/src/lib.rs`, `rust/crates/elegy-memory/src/storage/mod.rs`, `rust/crates/elegy-memory/src/storage/sqlite_store.rs`, `SESSION_TRACKING.md` |
| `cargo check` result | ✅ Pass — initial WU4 implementation and focused malformed-FTS fix both pass `cargo check -p elegy-memory --manifest-path C:\Users\Romain\Projects\Elegy\rust\Cargo.toml` |
| `cargo test` result | ✅ Pass after post-fix rerun via dedicated unit-test runner — `cargo test -p elegy-memory --manifest-path C:\Users\Romain\Projects\Elegy\rust\Cargo.toml` (28 passed, 0 failed) |
| Tests written | 5 focused async unit tests in `rust/crates/elegy-memory/src/storage/sqlite_store.rs`: store/get access tracking, content update + versioning, lifecycle + hard delete cascade, metadata/list filtering, and health report + contradiction handling |
| Deviations from plan | WU4 intentionally leaves `search`, `find_similar`, `purge_user`, and `purge_all` as explicit `StoreError::Validation` stubs so CRUD/lifecycle work can land without prematurely implementing WU5 hybrid search or later purge flows; automatic `memory_links` `supersedes` rows on update remain deferred because the current trait/schema surface versions content in-place without a second memory ID to link cleanly. |
| Blockers encountered | Dedicated unit-test validation initially exposed 5 `sqlite_store` failures with `Sqlite("database disk image is malformed")`; the root cause was WU4 treating the external-content `memories_fts` table like a normal table (`DELETE FROM` + reinsert) instead of using the FTS5 delete pseudo-command with the previous indexed payload. The issue is now resolved and the focused rerun passed. |
| Decisions made | Scoped each `SqliteMemoryStore` instance to a single authoritative `MemoryScope`, backed the `Send + Sync` trait requirement with `Arc<Mutex<rusqlite::Connection>>`, kept manual FTS synchronization for WU4 CRUD readiness, fixed the malformed-FTS regression by deleting prior external-content rows through the FTS5 delete pseudo-command before reinserting refreshed terms, added embedding write/staleness support for CRUD readiness, and recorded contradictions with a simple provenance-based reliability downgrade for the less trusted memory. |

## How to Read This File (for the human reviewer)

**Red flags to look for:**
1. **Canary errors** — If the agent can't recall what it just built, context is degrading
2. **Confidence dropping** — Self-assessed confidence below 3 = context pollution
3. **Increasing deviations** — More deviations in later WUs = the agent is losing the plot
4. **Compounding errors** — A fix in WU4 that references something wrong from WU2
5. **Preview drift** — If the agent's preview of the next WU doesn't match the actual plan, the prompt context is being compressed/lost

**What to do if degradation is detected:**
- Check `git log --oneline` for the last clean commit
- The session is still valuable — every completed WU with a passing commit is solid
- Start Session 2 (or a redo session) from the last clean commit
